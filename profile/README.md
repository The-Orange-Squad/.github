# The Orange Squad


We're a friendly community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for programming, art, designing or just having fun together. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started, we're here to support and encourage each other. Basically, we're just a bunch of folks who love to hang out. This is the GitHub organization for our services / repositories that are open-sourced, and primarily managed by LyubomirT (the founder). If you need any technical support, feel free to contact us by raising an issue or asking a question in the [server](https://discord.gg/4nVVhh29E3) directly!

### What is this all about?

Here we host the source code for anything the server has with an open source, sometimes binaries get shipped around as well, but that's less likely.

### Contribution

Contributions are welcome, no matter if you're a member of the server or not. You can freely explore the source code of anything here, and if you think that something needs your attention, go for changing that!

### Community Projects

For now we don't have any community projects launched for the server, but if you're willing to work on something, you can always DM any of the owners (e.g. I'm available in Discord with the handle `@lyubomirt`) to give you a repository to post your stuff / collaborate in. Happy coding!
