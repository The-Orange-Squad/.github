# The Orange Squad


We're a friendly community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for programming, art, designing or just having fun together. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started, we're here to support and encourage each other. Basically, we're just a bunch of folks who love to hang out. This is the GitHub organization for our services / repositories that are open-sourced, and primarily managed by LyubomirT (the founder). If you need any technical support, feel free to contact us by raising an issue or asking a question in the [server](https://discord.gg/4nVVhh29E3) directly!
